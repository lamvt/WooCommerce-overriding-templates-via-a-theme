WooCommerce-overriding-templates-via-a-theme
============================================

The template files of WooCommerce contain the markup and template structure for the front-end (and HTML emails) of your store. If you open these files youâ€™ll notice they all contain many hooks which will allow you to add / move content without having to edit the template files themselves. This method protects even further against any upgrade issues as the template files can be left completely untouched.
